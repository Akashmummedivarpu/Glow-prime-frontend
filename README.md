# GlowHaven - Frontend (Vite + React + Tailwind)

This is a simple starter frontend scaffold that reproduces the layout and pages from the screenshots you provided.

## What's included
- Vite + React
- React Router
- Tailwind CSS config
- Simple pages: Home, Products, Services, Cart, Orders, Bookings
- Booking modal, product/service cards
- Assets: hero images (copied from the container if available)

## How to run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Start dev server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open the URL shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)

## Notes
- The project is intentionally minimal; it uses static sample data.
- Images were copied from the provided container paths into `src/assets/`.
- If some images are missing, replace images in `src/assets/` with your own.
